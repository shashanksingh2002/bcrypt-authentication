  <h2>Endpoints</h2>
  <h3>GET /</h3>
  <p>This endpoint is used to check if the server is running. It returns a simple "running" message.</p>
  <h3>POST /signup</h3>
  <p>This endpoint is used for user registration. It requires the following parameters in the request body:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>token</code>: A token string used for authentication. The token value should be set to 'qwertyuiop1029384756'.</li>
    <li><code>email</code>: The email address of the user.</li>
    <li><code>password</code>: The password for the user.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example Request Body:</p>
  <pre>
{
  "token": "qwertyuiop1029384756",
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
  </pre>
  <p>Functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The endpoint checks if the provided token matches 'qwertyuiop1029384756' for authentication.</li>
    <li>The password is hashed using bcrypt.</li>
    <li>User details (email and hashed password) are stored in the database.</li>
    <li>If the user already exists in the database, it returns a response indicating that the user already exists.</li>
    <li>If the registration is successful, it redirects to the '/index.html' page.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>POST /login</h3>
  <p>This endpoint is used for user login. It requires the following parameters in the request body:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>email</code>: The email address of the user.</li>
    <li><code>password</code>: The password for the user.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example Request Body:</p>
  <pre>
{
  "email": "example@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
  </pre>
  <p>Functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It retrieves user details from the database based on the provided email.</li>
    <li>It compares the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database using bcrypt.</li>
    <li>If the password is correct, it redirects to the '/mainpage.html' page.</li>
    <li>If the password is incorrect, it returns a response indicating that the password is wrong.</li>
    <li>If the user does not exist in the database, it redirects to the '/signup.html' page.</li>
  </ul>

give a small description for github
ChatGPT
The GitHub repository for the bcrypt-authentication project contains the source code for a web application that implements user authentication using bcrypt. It includes both the frontend and backend components of the application. The repository showcases the usage of various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, bcrypt, and Postman.

The project's folder structure consists of two main folders: "database" and "public". The "database" folder contains the userdetails.json file, which serves as the file-based database for storing user information. The "public" folder contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the frontend of the application.

The server.js file represents the backend of the application, where the endpoints for user signup and login are defined. The fileop.js module handles file operations, such as reading and writing data to the userdetails.json file.

To use the bcrypt-authentication project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies using npm, and start the server. The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000. The endpoints provided allow users to register, login, and check the status of the server.

Please note that this repository serves as a demonstration and learning resource, and it may not include all the necessary security measures for a production-ready application. It is recommended to conduct proper security reviews and enhancements before deploying it in a production environment.
